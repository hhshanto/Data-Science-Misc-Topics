    "**What Is Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other variables (known as independent variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It predicts continuous/real values such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc."

    "Regression is a **supervised learning technique** which helps in finding the correlation between variables and enables us to predict the continuous output variable based on the one or more predictor variables. It is mainly used for **prediction, forecasting, time series modeling, and determining the causal-effect relationship between variables.**"

    "In Regression, we plot a graph between the variables which best fits the given datapoints, using this plot, the machine learning model can make predictions about the data. In simple words, **\"Regression shows a line or curve that passes through all the datapoints on target-predictor graph in such a way that the vertical distance between the datapoints and the regression line is minimum.\"** The distance between datapoints and line tells whether a model has captured a strong relationship or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of regression can be as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prediction of rain using temperature and other factors\n",
    "* Determining Market trends\n",
    "* Prediction of road accidents due to rash driving."

    "* **Dependent Variable**: The main factor in Regression analysis which we want to predict or understand is called the dependent variable. It is also called target variable.\n",
    "* **Independent Variable**: The factors which affect the dependent variables or which are used to predict the values of the dependent variables are called independent variable, also called as a predictor.\n",
    "* **Outliers**: Outlier is an observation which contains either very low value or very high value in comparison to other observed values. An outlier may hamper the result, so it should be avoided.\n",
    "* **Multicollinearity**: If the independent variables are highly correlated with each other than other variables, then such condition is called **Multicollinearity**. It should not be present in the dataset, because it creates problem while ranking the most affecting variable.\n",
    "* **Underfitting and Overfitting**: If our algorithm works well with the training dataset but not well with test dataset, then such problem is called Overfitting. And if our algorithm does not perform well even with training dataset, then such problem is called underfitting.\n",
    "* **Heteroscedasticity** :When the variation between the target variable and the independent variable is not constant, it is called heteroscedasticity. Example-As oneâ€™s income increases, the variability of food consumption will increase. A poorer person will spend a rather constant amount by always eating inexpensive food; a wealthier person may occasionally buy inexpensive food and at other times, eat expensive meals. Those with higher incomes display a greater variability of food consumption."
